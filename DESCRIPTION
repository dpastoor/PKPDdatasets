Description: ctm-datasets provides a number of simulated datasets to provide
    pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and demographic data to allow for easy
    teaching, testing, and visualization. The primary driver is to allow for
    datasets (other than Theoph) to be readily available. A secondary purpose
    is to provide a foundation to allow for easily generated reproducible
    examples in pharmacometrics.
