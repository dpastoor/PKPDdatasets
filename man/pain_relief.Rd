\description{
CTM_Nopain is a novel anti-inflammatory agent under preliminary investigation.  
A dose-ranging trial was conducted comparing placebo with 3 doses of CTM_Nopain (5mg, 20mg and 80 mg QD).  
The maximum tolerated dose is 160 mg per day.  
Plasma concentrations (mg/L) of the drug were measured at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3-8 hours. 
Pain score (0=no pain, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe) were obtained at time points when plasma concentration was collected.  
A pain score of 2 or more is considered as no pain relief. 
The model used is a one-compartment PK model with allometric model of weight on CL (exp 0.75) and volume (exp 1) 
with direct PD effect (Emax model).
